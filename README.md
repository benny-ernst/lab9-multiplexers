## Lab Questions

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
Multiplexers are useful for taking multiple inputs and simplifying it into one simple output, which simplifies the system and increases efficency. It can be used for optimizing digital traffic.

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
Demultiplexers are useful for taking one input and translating it into multiple outputs. This can be used for scenarios such as data routing when you need to separate the input.

### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)
Since it simplifies the boolean circuit, it makes the logic gate implementation a lot simpler.
